# Project 3: River Boat Vectors Simulation
Dhruv, Jeremy, Roberto
This project is for Rapid Prototyping and Design (39-245) at Carnegie Mellon University.
We attempt to design a simulation that will help teach kids about vectors and predictive analysis through rivers and boats; a very well known physics problem.
